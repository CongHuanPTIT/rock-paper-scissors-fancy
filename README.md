A recurring joke I've seen over the times of studying and looking at forums, groups,... is "AI = if-else until death". 

While I can see the funny side of said joke, there is also some truth. In "homework" codes, the basics of programming, we use these decision-making statements in nearly every problem we face. Given a condition, we have to map out all possible answers and display them through the lines we write. In my opinion, just like how "homework" codes are the introduction to programming, "if-else" statements are the introduction to AI and its' related subjects (Machine Learning, Deep Learning, etc.)

So I created a small game to demonstrate it.
